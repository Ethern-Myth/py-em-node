## Introduction

`py-em-node` is a Node.js package designed to facilitate the execution and management of Python scripts within a Node.js environment. It provides functions to install Python, read configuration files, and execute Python scripts seamlessly.

## Installation

You can install `py-em-node` via npm, yarn or pnpm:

```bash
npm install py-em-node
OR
pnpm add py-em-node
OR
yarn add py-em-node
```

## Usage

### Package.json OR Command-Line Interface (CLI)

`py-em-node` offers a command-line interface (CLI) or package.json for executing scripts directly from the terminal.

#### Example Usage

For this: Follow the Configuration Options as well

```bash
py-em-node start
```

OR

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "py-em-node start"
 },
```

pnpm start
OR
yarn start
```

This command will execute the Python script specified as the entry point in the configuration file.

Place this file in the root directory of your project.

#### Configuration Options

- `entryPoint`: Specifies the entry point Python file (default: `app.py`).
- `usePythonThree`: Specifies the use of python3 if installed on system

#### Example Configuration File (python.config.json)

```json
